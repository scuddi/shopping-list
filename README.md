# Welcome to my responsible shopping-list

This is my first project to train and learn the basics of DOM-Manipulation. It is part of the roadmap of the [Odin-Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The exercise is an exercise provided by [MDN-Web-Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents#active_learning_a_dynamic_shopping_list).

It is a very basic shopping list, in which you can add and delete items.
